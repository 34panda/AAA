# Applications Rules

## Open Sourced
App needs to be linked to some source code repository. It does not matter which one.

## Free of charge
App must be fully featured out of the box without some kind of paywall.

## Free as in Freedom
App works for you, not the opposite. Do whatever you want with the app.

## Ad-free
App must not be some kind of freeware or adware.

## Installed and tested by me
The app was installed on my main smartphone and used for about 15 minutes or more.

## Privacy-friendly
This section requires more work. Currently, I found 2 ways to check if an App is "private":
1. [εxodus](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/) trackers report. [Example](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.iven.musicplayergo/latest/).
2. Privacy policy in source code repo. [Example](https://github.com/enricocid/Music-Player-GO/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md).

## Easy to use
The application must take a maximum of one day to understand.

## Still developed or polished experience
App is actively developed (new releases and commits in source code repository) or at least polished experience (without some kind of bugs and crashes with the latest Android).

## Does not lack of features compared to "default app"
App must not punish user for using it because previous (usually proprietary) one was more feature rich.
Example: FOSS Music Players. I love MPV and VLC and I prefer more MPV over VLC on my desktop. 
But on Android platform MPV is very truncated from features compared to VLC.

## Does not need an account
App must not require an account to use it on the start. It is only allowed to optionally log in when you want to.

## Has dark theme
App must have AMOLED or typical dark theme to save your eyes from strain.
