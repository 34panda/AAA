# Applications Rules

## Open Sourced
App needs to be linked to some source code repository. It does not matter which one.

## Free of charge (on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) and source code repository releases)
App must be fully featured out of the box without some kind of paywall. There is only one app center with ability to require money - Google Play, hence the best method to get apps is F-Droid or source code repository.

## Free as in Freedom
App works for you, not the opposite. Do whatever you want with the app.

## Ad-free
App must not be some kind of freeware or adware.

## Installed and tested by me or by contributor
The app was installed on someone's main smartphone and used for about 15 minutes or more.

## Privacy-friendly
This section requires more work. Currently, I found 3 ways to check if an App is "private":
1. [εxodus](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/) trackers report. [Example](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.iven.musicplayergo/latest/).
2. Privacy policy in source code repo. [Example](https://github.com/enricocid/Music-Player-GO/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md).
3. F-Droid [Anti-Features](https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/). [Example](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/code.name.monkey.retromusic).

## Easy to use
The application must take a maximum of one day to understand.

## Still developed or polished experience
App is actively developed (new releases and commits in source code repository) or at least polished experience (without some kind of bugs and crashes with the latest Android).

## Does not lack features compared to proprietary app
App must not punish user for using it, because previous (usually proprietary) one was more feature rich.

## Does not need an account
App must not require an account to use it on the start. It is only allowed to optionally log in when you want to. The only exception are self-hosted apps.

## Has dark theme
App must have black AMOLED or grayish theme to save your eyes from strain.

## App Name ❤️ = Someone's Personal Favourite
When you use the app on a daily basis and love almost the entirety of it, you can place next to it a heart.
