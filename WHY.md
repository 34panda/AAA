# Why does it exist?

### I created this repo because: 
1. I wanted to create something my own.
2. Other list are boring plain text that is very generic (AppName - description).
3. Most of them are outdated.
4. I search for really niche apps that are hard to find, but I find them very useful.
5. To practice "MarkDown skills".
