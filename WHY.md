# Why does it exist?

### I created this repo because: 

1. I wanted to create something on my own.
2. Other lists are boring plain text that is very generic (AppName - description).
3. Most of them are outdated.
4. I share useful niche apps that are hard to find, and help creators maintain their hard work.
5. To improve my MarkDown proficiency.
